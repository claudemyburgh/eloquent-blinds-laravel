                "body" => "The Basswood series of blinds are made of a thicker, heavier wooden material and are available in a wide range of lacquered wood colors, providing a more robust and sturdy look. The natural beauty of wood brings warmth and coziness to any room, while also making windows the focal point. However, due to the natural characteristics of wood, variations in color, grain texture, and warping may occur depending on the environment. It is important to be cautious when using wood venetians in humid or wet areas, as they may warp. When close to the sea, it is advisable to keep the blinds in a pulled-up position when windows are fully opened to prevent salt build-up and prolong their lifespan. Cleaning should be done using a clean, dry feather duster, soft cloth, or dust mitt to gently wipe off dust and debris, and for significant residue build-up a mild detergent can be used. These blinds are supplied with ladder string and cords which are color-coordinated and a wood valance that finishes off the product beautifully.

                Wood venetians are not light-blackout products, they will allow some light into the room while ensuring privacy. They are available in 50mm width as it is more stable than narrower widths. They are also heavier than other products and it's recommended to not order sizes that would be too heavy to pull up. Basswood is a stable wood and suitable for venetian blinds but still a natural product. Slats should be tilted to the open position before pulling the blinds up. Be aware that dye lot differences are probable, therefore, it's recommended to order all blinds needed for a room at once, and to indicate if the blinds will be in one opening. Over time, some fading may occur, especially on darker colors.",
